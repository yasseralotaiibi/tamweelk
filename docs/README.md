# Riyada OpenBanking API Documentation

This folder hosts the OpenAPI contract and static demo assets for the Saudi Open Banking MVP. Key files:

- `openapi.yaml`: Primary API contract covering mocked CIBA flows, consent APIs and mock Nafath handlers.
- `demo/`: Minimal static walkthrough demonstrating the mocked backchannel login + consent experience.

The OpenAPI document is mounted at `/docs` when the API server is running. The static demo is served from `/demo`.
